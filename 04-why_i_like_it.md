# Why do I like it?
    - Constantly working on a different machine
        - 3 machines (groupon, home imac, laptop).  SSH + Tmux allows mobility without slowdown
    - Create your own IDE
    - Matches my VIM commands -- moving windows is the same, entering command mode, etc
    - My girlfriend loves CMD-Q
