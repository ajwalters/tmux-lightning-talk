# Why?
    - Detach from a session while processes persist
        - Great for SSH where you can lose your connection
    - Light-weight remote pairing
    - Ssh into a machine and get the same environment
    - Well-documented, consistent command interface
    - Easily scriptable
    - Fat finger prevention (eg- CMD-Q/W)

# Why Not screen?
    - Screen's dead, baby.  Screen's dead
        - bad code, hard to maintain
    - Configuration syntax is hard to grok
    - No vertical splitting
